		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p class="graf1"> I'm a visual storyteller and content creator from Bartlett, Illinois. As a senior at the
			University of Missouri, I study Journalism with an emphasis on multimedia producing.
		</p>
		<img class="content_photos img_2" src="img/max_bandits.jpg" alt="Max filming the Chicago Bandits" />
		<p class="graf2">When I was in high school, I worked for four summers as a paid intern for the Chicago Bandits,
			four-time women's National Pro Fastpitch champions. At this internship, I worked with Chicago Bandits staff and
			other high school students to produce a live stream for the softball team.
			I rotated among several production roles: director, graphic designer and camera operator. Through this experience,
			I became fascinated with the world of visual storytelling.

		<p class="graf3">When I came to the University of Missouri, I was interested in all the aspects of visual
			journalism. Naturally, I chose to specialize in multimedia producing and explored opportunities to gain more
			experience. In my first couple of years at the university, I was an active member of MUTV sports.
			I covered major university sporting events, produced videos and co-hosted a live TV show.

		<p class="graf4">During my last couple of years at the university, I have worked at various newsrooms: Newsy, the
			Columbia Missourian, KBIA radio, KOMU 8 and Vox Magazine. I produced stories that competed with those of other
			news outlets and learned from my own successes and failures as a young journalist.
