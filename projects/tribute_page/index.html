        <p id="tribute-info">Saitama (<span lang="ja-Kana">サイタマ</span>, Saitama) is the main protagonist of One-Punch Man and the most powerful being to exist in the series.
        Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from battle.
        <br>
        Initially just a hero for fun, Saitama later registers to be a professional hero for the Hero Association and
        defends his home in Z-City from monsters, villains, and other threats. Under the Hero Association, he is assigned the
        hero name Caped Baldy (<span lang="ja-Kana">ハゲマント</span>, Hagemanto; Viz: Bald Cape) and is currently ranked 7 in the B-Class.
